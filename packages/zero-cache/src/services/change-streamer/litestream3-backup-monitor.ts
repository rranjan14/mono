 *
 * See: https://github.com/rocicorp/litestream/pull/3
 *
 * Note that change log entries cannot simply be purged as soon as they
 * have been applied and backed up by litestream. Consider the case in which
 * litestream backs up new wal segments every minute, but it takes 5 minutes
 * to restore a replica: if a zero-cache starts restoring a replica at
 * minute 0, and new watermarks are replicated at minutes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
 * purging changelog records as soon as those watermarks are replicated would
 * result in the zero-cache not being able to catch up from minute 0 once it
 * has finished restoring the replica.
 *
 * The `/snapshot` reservation protocol is used to prevent premature change
 * log cleanup:
 * - Clients restoring a snapshot initiate a `/snapshot` request and hold that
 *   request open while it restores its snapshot, prepares it, and
 *   starts its subscription to the change stream. During this time, no
 *   cleanups are scheduled.
 * - When the subscription is started, the interval since the beginning of
 *   of the reservation is tracked to increase the background cleanup delay
 *   interval if needed. The reservation is ended (and request closed), and
 *   cleanup scheduling is resumed with the current delay interval.
 *
 * Note that the reservation request is the primary mechanism by which
 * premature change log cleanup is prevented. The cleanup delay interval is
 * a secondary safeguard.
 *
 * Additionally, because the watermarks reported by litestream metrics
 * reflect what litestream *believes* has been backed up (which has been
 * observed to diverge from reality when uploads silently fail), the cleanup
 * watermark is only advanced after verifying it against the actual backup
 * state in the replica destination via a {@link BackupStateVerifier}. If the
 * actual backup state stays behind the claimed progress for longer than
 * {@link WEDGED_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS}, the backup is treated as wedged and the
 * process is shut down rather than risk corrupting the backup.
