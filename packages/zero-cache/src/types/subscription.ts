/**
 * A Subscription abstracts a continuous, logically infinite stream of messages intended
 * for serial processing. Unlike the more general Node `Stream` API, a Subscription has
 * a limited API with specific semantics:
 *
 * * **Serial processing**: Messages must be consumed via the {@link AsyncIterable}
 *   interface, e.g.
 *   ```ts
 *   const subscription = server.subscribe(parameters);
 *
 *   for await (const message of subscription) {
 *     await process(message);  // fully process the message before consuming the next
 *   }
 *   ```
 *
 *   Moreover, the consumer is expected to completely process each message before
 *   requesting the next. This is important for cleanup semantics (explained later).
 *
 * * **cancel()**, not close(): The underlying data in a subscription is logically infinite
 *   and only terminated when the consumer is no longer interested in receiving the messages
 *   (or requires a Subscription with a different configuration). As such, there is no API
 *   for gracefully closing the subscription after pending messages are consumed; rather,
 *   cancellation is immediate, and upon cancellation, pending messages are dropped. A
 *   Subscription can also be terminated with exceptional (i.e. `Error`) circumstances,
 *   for which the behavior is equivalent.
 *
 * * **Coalescing** (optional): A producer can configure pending messages in the Subscription
 *   to be merged together with a {@link Options.coalesce coalesce} function. This is useful
 *   for semantics in which the consumer is not necessarily interested in every incremental
 *   change, but rather the cumulative change since the last processed message. A
 *   Subscription with coalescing is guaranteed to have at most one outstanding message,
 *   regardless of how quickly messages are produced and consumed. This effectively constrains
 *   the amount of outstanding work in the system.
 *
 * ### Resource Tracking and Cleanup
 *
 * Because message consumption is constrained to the async iteration API, standard
 * control flow mechanisms allow the producer to perform bookkeeping without any
 * explicit cleanup actions on the part of the consumer. This includes:
 *
 * * **Per-message cleanup**: Each request for the {@link AsyncIterator.next next}
 *   message, or the termination of the iteration, signals that the consumer has
 *   finished processing the previous message. The producer of a Subscription can
 *   supply a {@link Options.consumed consumed} callback to receive these processed
 *   messages, allowing it to clean up attached resources (e.g. TransactionPools, etc.).
 *
 * * **Per-subscription cleanup**: The producer of a Subscription can supply a
 *   {@link Options.cleanup cleanup} callback that is invoked when the Subscription
 *   is terminated, either explicitly via {@link Subscription.cancel cancel()} /
 *   {@link Subscription.fail fail()}, or implicitly when an iteration is exited via a
 *  `break`, `return`, or `throw` statement. All unconsumed messages are passed to the
 *   call back to facilitate bookkeeping.
 *
 * @param T The external message type, published to the AsyncIterable
 * @param M The internal message type used in the producer-side interfaces
 *          (e.g. {@link push}, {@link Options.consumed}, {@link Options.coalesce},
 *          and {@link Options.cleanup}). This is often the same as the external type
 *          T, but may be diverged to facilitate internal bookkeeping.
