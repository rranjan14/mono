   * suspended React Native app, a sleeping laptop, a throttled background tab
   * --- wall-clock keeps advancing while no reconnect attempt can run, so

   * alone, but the costs are asymmetric --- crediting a busy period back just
   * grants a bit more time to connect, whereas failing to credit a real freeze
   * produces a user-visible bogus disconnect --- so we credit.
