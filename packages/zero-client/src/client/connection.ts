/**
 * The current connection state of the Zero instance. One of the following states:
 *
 * - `initializing`: The client is loading its local store. Nothing has been
 *   sent to the server yet, so time spent here depends on the device and the
 *   amount of local data, not on the network. Entered once, when the Zero
 *   instance is created, and followed by `connecting`.
 * - `connecting`: The client is actively trying to connect every 5 seconds.
 * - `disconnected`: The client is now in an "offline" state. It will continue
 *   to try to connect every 5 seconds.
 * - `connected`: The client has opened a successful connection to the server.
 * - `needs-auth`: Authentication is invalid or expired. No connection retries will be made
 *   until the host application calls `connect()`.
 * - `error`: A fatal error occurred. No connection retries will be made until the host
 *   application calls `connect()` again.
 * - `closed`: The client was shut down (for example via `zero.close()`). This is
 *   a terminal state, and a new Zero instance must be created to reconnect.
