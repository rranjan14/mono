 * yields nothing and pushes never happen. When the real pipeline is attached
 * the view is hydrated with a single `fetch`, whose rows are delivered to the
 * view as add changes, so the view sees the data exactly as it would see rows
 * arriving incrementally.
 *
 * This lets `materialize()` stay synchronous and return a view immediately
 * while the expensive pipeline construction and hydration are postponed, for
 * example until the client's replica has been loaded into the IVM sources.
