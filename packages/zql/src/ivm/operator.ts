   * filter.
   *
   * Always a `NoSubqueryCondition` — anything passed via `req.filter` must
   * already have had correlated subqueries stripped (see `transformFilters`).
   *
   * Contract:
   * - The only operator that *introduces* `req.filter` is `FilterStart`. It
   *   AND-merges its static condition with whatever `req.filter` it receives
   *   and forwards the merged value upstream. No other operator should
   *   construct a `req.filter`.
   * - "Pass-through" fetch operators (`Skip`, `Take`, `Join`, `FlippedJoin`,
   *   `UnionFanIn`, `UnionFanOut`) MUST preserve `req.filter` when forwarding
   *   to their input — typically via `{...req, ...overrides}` spread. Dropping
   *   it silently regresses predicate pushdown for queries below the
   *   forwarding operator.
   * - Operators that *initiate* internal fetches (e.g., `Join.#pushChildChange`,
   *   `FlippedJoin.#pushChildChange`, `UnionFanIn.#pushInternalChange`,
   *   `Take`'s push-time bound recomputation) construct fresh
   *   `FetchRequest`s without `req.filter`, and that is correct: there is no
   *   inbound consumer-side filter at those call sites. Any `FilterStart`
   *   that sits between such an internal fetch and the source will still
   *   apply its own condition on the way through, so the source still gets
   *   the right WHERE.
   * - `Cap` is *not* a pass-through: it intentionally builds fresh
   *   `{constraint}` requests when replaying tracked PKs and drops any
   *   incoming `req.filter`. This is sound only because `Cap`'s sole
   *   consumer in production is a `Join`'s child fetch (see
   *   `Join.#processParentNode` in `join.ts`), which itself never carries
   *   `req.filter` — Join's child fetches are constructed with just
   *   `{constraint}` derived from join keys. If `Cap` is ever wired below
   *   something that does push a `req.filter`, this carve-out becomes a
   *   correctness bug.
